RESUME PROMPT FOR NEXT SESSION:

I'm continuing work on the Hive Studio AI website. I want to add a founder bio section and logo carousel to the "Why Choose Hive Studio" section.

**What was completed:**
- Analyzed project structure and current About section
- Collected Aaron's bio text and professional photo
- Identified 22 carousel logos at: /Users/aaronuitenbroek/projects/hivestudio-ai/frontend/src/assets/logos/carousel-images/
- Determined grayscale logos need light background section to avoid white squares on dark theme
- Created 3-step implementation plan

**Data saved to:**
/Users/aaronuitenbroek/projects/hivestudio-ai/CLAUDE_SESSION_DATA/
- founder_bio_text.txt (bio content)
- project_analysis.md (detailed analysis)
- resume_prompt.txt (this file)

**Next step:** Implement Step 1 - Save Aaron's photo and create FounderSection component

**Quick task:** Go to Step 1 of the implementation plan in project_analysis.md and start with saving the photo and creating the founder section component.
